Yes, the provided code is executable. It is a Python script that interacts with AWS services to perform the following tasks:

1. Load configuration settings for a specified environment.
2. Create an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster.
3. Configure AWS CloudWatch alarms to monitor the health of the EKS cluster.
4. Scale worker nodes for the EKS cluster via Auto Scaling Groups.

To execute this script, you need to have the following prerequisites:

1. **AWS Credentials**: Ensure you have configured your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI or environment variables.
2. **Required Python Packages**: Install the necessary Python packages (`boto3`) using the following command:
    ```sh
    pip install boto3
    ```

3. **Configuration Files**: Ensure that the JSON configuration files (e.g., `dev_config.json`, `staging_config.json`, `production_config.json`) are present in the same directory as the script.

4. **Environment Variables**: Set the required environment variables (`API_KEY`, `DB_PASSWORD`) if they are used in your configuration.

To run the script, execute the following command in your terminal:
```sh
python /opt/anaconda3/envs/edureka_env/Edureka/Edureka/well-architected-aft/Eks_env_config.py
```

The script will prompt you to enter the environment (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `production`) and then proceed with the operations based on the configuration for that environment.

5. **Other considerations**

Specifically:

    Validation of Required Keys: The load_config() function now explicitly checks for the presence of all required keys (e.g., cluster_name, role_arn, subnet_ids, etc.) in the configuration dictionary. If any key is missing or invalid, it raises a warning so the issue can be flagged early on, preventing runtime errors later in the script.

    Warnings for Missing Environment Variables: Critical environment variables such as API_KEY and DB_PASSWORD are also checked. If they are not set, the script warns the user, ensuring the configuration is as complete as possible before proceeding.

    Robust Error Handling: Additional error handling and logging mechanisms have been implemented across all functions, ensuring that issues like missing keys, invalid configurations, or failures during API calls are captured and logged with descriptive messages.

6. **Set Up AWS CLI Credentials:**    

1. Configure your AWS CLI with proper credentials and default region. Run the following command: aws configure in your terminal.

2. Provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default Region (e.g., us-east-1), and output format (e.g., json).

3. Ensure the IAM user or role you're using has sufficient permissions for EKS, CloudWatch, and Auto Scaling operations.

4. Provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default Region (e.g., us-east-1), and output format (e.g., json).

5. Ensure the IAM user or role you're using has sufficient permissions for EKS, CloudWatch, and Auto Scaling operations.

{
  "cluster_name": "my-cluster",
  "role_arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/EKS-Cluster-Role",
  "subnet_ids": ["subnet-abc123", "subnet-def456"],
  "security_group_ids": ["sg-123abc"],
  "autoscaling_group_name": "EKS-AutoScaling-Group",
  "desired_capacity": 3
}

6. Set Environment Variables:
    Define the following required environment variables for sensitive data:

    export API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    export DB_PASSWORD="your_db_password_here"
7. Confirm that the environment variables are set using:
    echo $API_KEY
    echo $DB_PASSWORD
8. AWS Permissions:
    Ensure the IAM role or user associated with your credentials has permissions 
    for the following AWS services:

        EKS (e.g., eks:CreateCluster, eks:DescribeCluster)
        CloudWatch (e.g., cloudwatch:PutMetricAlarm)
        Auto Scaling (e.g., autoscaling:SetDesiredCapacity)
        Steps to Run the Script

    Save the Script:
        Copy the entire Python code into a file called deploy_eks_cluster.py

9. Run the Script:
    Open a terminal or command prompt and execute the script with the desired 
    environment (e.g., dev, staging, production):
    python deploy_eks.py
10. The script will prompt you to enter the environment. Enter one of the 
    configured environments (e.g., dev).
11. Observe the Output:

    The script will perform the following tasks:
        Load the appropriate configuration for the selected environment.
        Create an EKS cluster based on the provided settings.
        Configure CloudWatch alarms to monitor the cluster's health.
        Scale worker nodes in the Auto Scaling group to the desired capacity.
    Youâ€™ll see informational logs in the terminal for each task, such as:    
    Successfully loaded configuration file: dev_config.json

    EKS cluster 'my-cluster' creation initiated successfully.
    CloudWatch alarm configured for cluster 'my-cluster'.
    Auto Scaling Group 'EKS-AutoScaling-Group' scaled to 3 instances.
